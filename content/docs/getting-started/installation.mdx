description: Get started using free components in your NextJS 14 project with a few simple steps.
---

## Pre-Requisite

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js**: Make sure Node.js is installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). This is required to manage your project's dependencies and run the development server.

## Project Initialization

To start a new NextJS project, use the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

- npx: This is a package runner tool that comes with Node.js. It allows you to run commands from packages without globally installing them.
- create-next-app@latest: This command creates a new NextJS project with the latest version. It sets up a new NextJS application with a default configuration and project structure.

Follow the prompts to name your project and choose additional options if any. Once the process is complete, navigate into your project directory:

```bash
cd your-project-name
```

## Configuration
Configure your project to use custom components effectively. The following configurations are necessary:

- **Tailwind Config**: Install Tailwind CSS and its peer dependencies:
    ```
    npm install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
    ```
   Initialize Tailwind CSS by running:
    ```
    npx tailwindcss init -p
    ```
   This will generate tailwind.config.js and postcss.config.js files. Customize tailwind.config.js to include any custom themes or configurations.

- **Globals.css Config:** Additional css styles would be written here, for some components.

- **.env Setup:** This setup is for components which use Backend Code.

--------------------------------------------
By completing these steps, you'll be ready to start integrating and using custom components in your NextJS 14 project. Happy coding!
