## What are Components?

Components are reusable elements in website development that help in creating scalable and efficient codebases. They enable developers to build modular applications by encapsulating functionality and UI into discrete units.

- **Reusability**: Components can be used across multiple parts of a website or application, reducing the need for redundant code.
- **Scalability**: By breaking down complex interfaces into manageable pieces, components make it easier to scale and maintain projects.
- **Efficiency**: Components streamline development processes, allowing for faster and more efficient code management.

**`Electroplix provides free components that can be easily integrated into your projects.`**

> **Build Websites 10x Faster and More Efficiently**: By leveraging our components, you can accelerate your development process and focus on creating unique features and functionality.

## Tech Stack

Electroplix components are built with a robust and modern tech stack to ensure high performance and flexibility:

- **NextJS**: A popular React framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated applications.
- **Framer-motion**: A powerful library for creating animations and transitions in React applications.
- **ThreeJS**: A 3D library that enables the creation of interactive 3D graphics within the browser.
- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that provides a highly customizable design system for building responsive interfaces.
